Change Log
==========

Version 1.1.0 *(2016-06-08)*
----------------------------

 * New: Added **firstIndexOf** - to help with finding the index of the first Collection item that matches a predicate.
 * New: Added **singleIndexOf** - same as firstIndexOf, but verifies that no more than 1 Collection item matches the predicate.
 * New: Renamed `IPredicate` and `IMapper` interfaces to `Predicate` and `Mapper`, respectively, thus making the naming slightly more Java-esque.


Version 1.0.0 *(2015-08-14)*
----------------------------

Initial release.
